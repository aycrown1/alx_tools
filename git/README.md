### Git

Git is a distributed version control system (VCS) that allows multiple people to collaborate on a project by tracking and managing changes to files. It was created by Linus Torvalds, the same person who developed the Linux operating system.

#### Version Control
Version control refers to the practice of tracking and managing changes to files over time. It allows you to keep a history of all modifications made to a project, enabling you to revert to previous versions if needed, compare changes between versions, and collaborate effectively with others.

#### Github

GitHub, on the other hand, is a web-based platform built around Git. It provides hosting services for Git repositories and adds additional features to facilitate collaboration and project management. With GitHub, you can create repositories to store your projects, collaborate with others through pull requests, manage issues and project boards, and more.

GitHub also provides features like branch management, which allows multiple developers to work on different features or fixes simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. It also includes extensive documentation, community features, and integrations with various development tools, making it a popular choice for open-source projects and team collaborations.
